#### There's a hover-over effect for each class on the schedule that prompts the user to click on each one, which will then display detailed information in a modal.

## Miscellaneous
 - Currently, the website only supports class search for spring 2023 semester,
but can very easily be adapted to add all other past semester as well.
 - Similarly, more search filters could be added in the future.
